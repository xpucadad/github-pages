<h2>Hello Monny!</h2>
<h3>Another beautiful morning in Palm Springs!</h3>
<p>This a the 1st paragraph in a meaningless story.</p>
<h3>Mundane Progress</h3>
<p>Still plugging along; still haven't implemented a single piece of the actual Raft protocol.</p>
<h3>Big breakthrough!</h3>
<p>There was some kind of a problem with using queues to communicate amoung the raft
  servers. I had no problems with it in my test server program, but in the real one I ran
into issues with stuff getting put into the wrong queues. I worked on this for a couple of days and was to able to get it resolved.</p>
<p>Enter pipes. Finally I gave up on the queues and wrote a small server with
  subprocesses and managed to get it to work successfully. I then updated raft_server
  to use pipes in the same way instead of queues. It now works! The shutdown messages
  are getting sent to the correct server! Yeah!
<h3> Old notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Our raft server/node code made good progress today. Started
  proxy handling</li>
  <li>The new stuff in Fleek is not obvious. Probably need to dive down a bit</li>
  <li>Looks like we need to change the process communication for raft
  to be asyncio queues with wait_for timeouts. See the async_tut_1
  project. </li>
  <li>Changed my mind on that last one. The nodes will now run as
    subprocesses and use mp.Queues to implement the RPC.</li>
  <li>Need to figure out what mechanism to use for 1) controlling
    and stopping the servers and 2) issueing client reques</li>
  <li>Figured out stopping the servers; same method will work for sending client requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2020-05-14 1050</h3>
<ul>
<li>Haven't worked on my Raft stuff for a long time. Need to get back to it.</li>
<li>IPFS is not working that well for me. I loaded a file using the IFPS desktop and tried to use the link it provided, but it didn't work.</li>
<li>Fleek added IPFS file storage and in this environment provided a link that worked. However, there will eventually be a charge to use this once it's out of beta, so I'll most likely have to remove the (rather large) file.</li>
